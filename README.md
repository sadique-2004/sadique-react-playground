# ðŸš€ sadique-react-playground
This repository is my personal React learning playground, where I experiment with different concepts, build small projects, and explore best practices. It serves as a progress tracker for my React journey and a reference for future projects.

# ðŸ”¥ What's Inside?
âœ… React fundamentals (components, props, state)
âœ… Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.)
âœ… Form handling and validation (react-hook-form, Formik)
âœ… State management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
âœ… Routing (react-router-dom)
âœ… UI libraries (Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI, etc.)
âœ… Performance optimization & best practices
âœ… Small projects & real-world use cases

# ðŸ“Œ Why This Repo?
To document my learning progress in React
To practice and experiment with new concepts
To build a collection of reusable components and patterns
